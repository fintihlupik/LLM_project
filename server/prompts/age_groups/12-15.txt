Create a financial post for teenagers ages 12–15. Use clear, respectful language and examples from their world (phones, games, school). Explain why understanding money matters and how it gives them freedom and choices.

The tone should be educational but relatable. Use emotional appeal and phrases that spark reflection, like:
- “Knowing about money is knowing how to choose your future.”
- “Saving is not boring—it’s powerful.”

Include examples like:
- Saving for a phone or trip
- What a budget is
- How interest works
- What a debit card does

Format for Instagram carousel or X thread. End with a CTA like:
- “Want to be financially free? Start here.”
- “Follow for tips that actually help.”

Use emojis, idiomatic expressions, or culturally relevant references only when appropriate and clearly beneficial for emotional resonance or clarity. Humor may be used lightly and respectfully, especially when it helps simplify or humanize financial concepts.
