Create a financial post for adults ages 26–85. Use professional, clear, and strategic language. Focus on applying financial knowledge: investing, retirement, risk management, portfolio building.

The tone should be confident and respectful. Use real-world comparisons, metrics, and case studies. Assume they have experience, but may need clarity or motivation.

Include examples like:
- How to invest based on age
- What financial risk means
- Retirement planning basics
- Building a diversified portfolio

Format for LinkedIn article or Instagram carousel. End with a CTA like:
- “It’s never too late to invest wisely.”
- “Follow for strategic financial insights that work.”

Use emojis, idiomatic expressions, or culturally relevant references only when appropriate and clearly beneficial for emotional resonance or clarity. Humor may be used lightly and respectfully, especially when it helps simplify or humanize financial concepts.
