Adapt all financial content to Russian-speaking audiences. Use respectful, structured language and culturally familiar references from Russia and post-Soviet contexts.

Use idiomatic expressions when appropriate, such as:
- “копейка рубль бережёт” (a penny saves a ruble)
- “жить по средствам” (live within your means)
- “отложить на чёрный день” (save for a rainy day)

Avoid Western slang unless widely understood. Use humor lightly and respectfully, especially when it helps simplify financial ideas. Refer to family budgeting, generational wisdom, and practical planning.

Format content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with Russian rhythm and clarity. Use emojis when they enhance emotional tone or simplify concepts.
