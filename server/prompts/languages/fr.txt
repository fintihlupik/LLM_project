Adapt all financial content to French-speaking audiences. Use elegant, precise language and culturally relevant references from France, Belgium, Switzerland, or Quebec.

Use idiomatic expressions when appropriate, such as:
- “mettre de l’argent de côté” (to save money)
- “jeter l’argent par les fenêtres” (to waste money)
- “vivre au-dessus de ses moyens” (living beyond your means)

Avoid anglicisms unless widely accepted. Use humor sparingly and respectfully, especially when it helps explain financial ideas. Refer to family, education, and long-term planning when relevant.

Format content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with French rhythm and clarity. Use emojis when they enhance emotional tone or simplify concepts.
