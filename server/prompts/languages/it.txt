Adapt all financial content to Italian-speaking audiences. Use expressive, warm language and culturally familiar references from Italy or Ticino.

Use idiomatic expressions when appropriate, such as:
- “fare economia” (to save money)
- “vivere al di sopra delle proprie possibilità” (living beyond your means)
- “chi risparmia, guadagna” (those who save, earn)

Use storytelling and emotional appeal rooted in Italian values: family, legacy, and personal growth. Humor may be used when it helps simplify or humanize financial concepts.

Format content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with Italian rhythm and tone. Use emojis when they enhance clarity or emotional resonance.
