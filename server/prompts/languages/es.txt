Adapt all financial content to Spanish-speaking audiences. Use warm, direct language and culturally familiar references from Latin America and Spain. Prioritize clarity, emotional resonance, and community values.

Use idiomatic expressions when appropriate, such as:
- “tirar la casa por la ventana” (overspending)
- “guardar para las vacas flacas” (saving for hard times)
- “el que guarda siempre tiene” (those who save always have)

Avoid literal translations of English idioms. Use humor lightly and respectfully, especially when it helps simplify financial concepts. When relevant, refer to family, everyday life, and generational wisdom.

Format content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with rhythm and structure suited to Spanish communication style. Use emojis when they enhance clarity or emotional tone.
