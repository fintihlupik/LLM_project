Adapt the financial content to Cameroonian French. Use direct, practical tone with local expressions and references to everyday financial habits.

Include idioms such as:
- “être fauché” (to be broke)
- “faire les comptes” (to budget)

Refer to mobile banking, informal savings, and cost of living. Use Camfranglais rhythm when appropriate. Humor may be used to simplify financial ideas.
