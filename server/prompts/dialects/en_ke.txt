Adapt the financial content to Kenyan English. Use friendly, practical tone with a blend of English and Swahili-influenced phrasing when appropriate.

Include expressions like:
- “being broke is normal”
- “save kidogo kidogo” (save little by little)
- “mchezo wa pesa” (game of money)

Refer to mobile money (e.g. M-Pesa), everyday savings tips, and budgeting strategies. Tone may include soft humor and hopeful encouragement.
