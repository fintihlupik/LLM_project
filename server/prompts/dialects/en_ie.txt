Adapt the financial content to Irish English. Use warm, conversational tone with subtle humor and local expressions. Prioritize clarity and emotional resonance.

Use idioms such as:
- “skint” (broke)
- “throw a few bob in” (contribute money)
- “mind your pennies” (save carefully)

Avoid overly formal tone. Refer to student grants, rent, and savings habits. Use emojis when they enhance emotional tone or simplify concepts. Format for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with Irish rhythm.
