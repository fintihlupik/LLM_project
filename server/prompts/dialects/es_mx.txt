Adapt the financial content to Mexican Spanish. Use warm, expressive language and common idioms from everyday life in Mexico. Prioritize friendly tone, emotional relatability, and rhythmic phrasing.

Use culturally familiar expressions such as:
- “ponerse las pilas” (to get moving/take responsibility)
- “te lo digo al chile” (to speak honestly)
- “tirar la casa por la ventana” (to spend excessively)

Incorporate subtle references to family culture, savings habits, and aspirational values. Humor and emojis may be used when they enhance clarity or emotional tone. Avoid overly formal Spanish and prefer familiar, natural phrasing.
