Adapt the financial content to Australian English. Use casual, upbeat tone and familiar Aussie expressions when relevant. Keep things straight-talking and practical.

Include idioms like:
- “Flat broke”
- “On a shoestring”
- “Sorted” (handled/resolved)

Financial advice should feel accessible and relaxed. Use culturally familiar examples like rent, lifestyle costs, superannuation, and savings goals. Humor may be dry or cheeky. Format content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with Aussie rhythm and no fluff.
