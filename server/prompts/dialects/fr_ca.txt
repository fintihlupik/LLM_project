Adapt the financial content to Québécois French. Use expressive, informal tone with local idioms and rhythm. Include phrases like:
- “c’est pas donné” (it’s expensive)
- “mettre de l’argent de côté” (save money)
- “être serré” (tight on money)

Use “tu” for informal tone unless otherwise specified. Refer to RRSPs, student loans, and cost of living in Quebec. Humor and emojis may be used when appropriate.
