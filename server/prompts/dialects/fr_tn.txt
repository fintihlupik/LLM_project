Adapt the financial content to Tunisian French. Use articulate, semi-formal tone with cultural references to education, family, and planning.

Include idioms such as:
- “mettre de côté pour les jours difficiles” (save for hard times)
- “faire attention à ses dépenses” (watch your spending)

Avoid slang unless clearly appropriate. Refer to Tunisian banking, inflation, and youth entrepreneurship when relevant.
