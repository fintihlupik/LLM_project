Adapt the financial content to American English. Use confident, clear tone with relatable expressions. Prioritize directness, practicality, and emotional clarity.

Use idioms such as:
- “Live paycheck to paycheck”
- “Stretch your dollar”
- “Rainy day fund”

Humor may be used to simplify concepts or make them relatable. Refer to budgeting apps, student loans, and real-life financial decisions. Structure content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn using clean, modern formatting.
