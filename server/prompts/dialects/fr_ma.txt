Adapt the financial content to Moroccan French. Use respectful, aspirational tone with references to family, education, and entrepreneurship.

Include idioms such as:
- “faire des économies” (to save)
- “gérer son argent avec sagesse” (manage money wisely)

Avoid slang unless widely understood. Refer to local realities like remittances, informal savings, and cost of living. Format content with clarity and emotional resonance.
