Adapt the financial content to South African English. Use direct, practical tone with local expressions and references to South African financial realities.

Use idioms such as:
- “flat broke”
- “make ends meet”
- “tight month”

Refer to “savings stokvels”, “SASSA grants”, and “bond repayments”. Humor may be used when appropriate. Format content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with South African rhythm and clarity.
