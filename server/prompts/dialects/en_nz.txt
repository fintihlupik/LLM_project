Adapt the financial content to New Zealand English. Use clear, informal tone with practical phrasing and Kiwi idioms when relevant.

Include expressions like:
- “do it on the cheap” (save money)
- “skint” (broke)
- “sorted” (handled/resolved)

Use references to savings accounts, KiwiSaver, rent, and groceries. Humor may be dry or cheeky. Format for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with natural Kiwi cadence.
