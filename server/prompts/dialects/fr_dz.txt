Adapt the financial content to Algerian French. Use clear, respectful tone with references to everyday life and financial resilience.

Include idioms such as:
- “être à sec” (to be broke)
- “faire des calculs” (to budget)

Avoid overly formal phrasing. Refer to family budgeting, informal savings, and cost of living. Humor may be used lightly to simplify financial ideas.
