Adapt the financial content to Indian English. Use respectful, aspirational tone with clear structure and culturally familiar references. Avoid slang unless widely accepted.

Use idioms such as:
- “cut your coat according to your cloth” (live within your means)
- “penny wise, pound foolish”
- “make hay while the sun shines”

Refer to “SIPs”, “FDs”, “UPI”, and “EMIs”. Use examples from student life, family budgeting, and entrepreneurship. Format content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with Indian rhythm and clarity.
