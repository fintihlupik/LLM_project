Adapt the financial content to Uruguayan Spanish. Use clear, calm language with cultural references relevant to Uruguayan families and young professionals.

Include idioms like:
- “estar corto de plata” (broke)
- “manejar la guita” (manage money)
- “guardar para el futuro” (save for later)

Use “vos” instead of “tú” for informal tone. Refer to inflation, rent, education, and investment options like “AFAP” or “cuentas de ahorro”.
