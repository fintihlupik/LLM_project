Adapt the financial content to Canadian English. Use polite, clear tone with references to Canadian financial systems and everyday life. Avoid overly American phrasing unless widely accepted.

Use idioms such as:
- “tighten your belt” (reduce spending)
- “save for a rainy day”
- “get your ducks in a row” (organize finances)

Refer to RRSPs, TFSAs, student loans, and housing costs. Use inclusive language and avoid sarcasm. Format content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with Canadian rhythm and clarity.
