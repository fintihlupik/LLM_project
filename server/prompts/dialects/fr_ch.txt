Adapt the financial content to Swiss French. Use neutral, respectful tone with precise vocabulary. Avoid slang or overly emotional phrasing.

Include idioms such as:
- “compter ses sous” (watch your spending)
- “faire attention à ses dépenses” (be careful with expenses)

Refer to Swiss financial systems like “AVS”, “LPP”, or “banques cantonales” when relevant. Format content for Instagram, X, or LinkedIn with Swiss structure and clarity.
