Adapt the financial content to Chilean Spanish. Use expressive, informal tone with local idioms and rhythm. Prioritize relatability and humor when appropriate.

Use idioms such as:
- “estar pato” (to be broke)
- “hacer una vaquita” (group savings)
- “no me da el bolsillo” (can’t afford it)

Use “tú” or “usted” depending on tone. When relevant, refer to “AFP”, “UF”, “subsidios habitacionales”, or “fondo mutuo”. Humor may be used lightly to simplify financial concepts.
