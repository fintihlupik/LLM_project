Adapt the financial content to Colombian Spanish. Use polite, enthusiastic tone with expressions rooted in Colombian everyday speech. Prioritize clarity, optimism, and gentle persuasion.

Include idioms like:
- “estar en la olla” (to be broke)
- “echarle cabeza” (to think carefully)
- “guardar para las vacas flacas” (save for tough times)

Avoid aggressive or sarcastic tone. When appropriate, include references to regional values: family support, education, and community progress. Use “usted” or “tú” depending on emotional tone, but keep it friendly.
