Adapt the financial content to Peruvian Spanish. Use respectful, calm tone with clear explanations. Include references to everyday life and savings culture in Peru.

Use idioms such as:
- “estar misio” (to be broke)
- “hacer una chanchita” (group savings)
- “ahorrar para la universidad” (common goal)

Avoid slang that’s too regional unless clearly appropriate. Use “tú” or “usted” depending on tone. When relevant, refer to “AFP”, “CTS”, or “billetera digital”.
