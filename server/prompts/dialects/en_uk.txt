Adapt the financial content to British English. Use polite, structured tone with dry or understated humor when appropriate. Avoid overly emotive phrasing unless clearly warranted.

Use idioms such as:
- “Skint” (broke)
- “Spend a few quid” (spend money)
- “Bit of a pickle” (in trouble)

Refer to British banking terms, benefits, or references (e.g. ISA accounts, council tax, cost-of-living crisis). When appropriate, inject a clever or ironic tone. Structure content for X or LinkedIn with measured, articulate phrasing.
