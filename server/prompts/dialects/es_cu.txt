Adapt the financial content to Cuban Spanish. Use informal, expressive tone with local idioms and conversational style. Keep the rhythm lively and relatable.

Include Cuban expressions such as:
- “no da la talla” (doesn’t measure up)
- “resolver” (to make ends meet creatively)
- “estar en candela” (to be in financial trouble)

Include cultural references to everyday resilience, inventiveness, and interpersonal warmth. Humor can be used when appropriate. Avoid stiff or textbook Spanish. Use natural phrasing to reflect Cuban speech patterns.
