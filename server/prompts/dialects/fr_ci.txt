Adapt the financial content to Ivorian French. Use expressive, informal tone with local idioms and rhythm.

Include phrases like:
- “faire commerce” (to do business)
- “être dans le trou” (to be broke)

Use Abidjan-style phrasing when appropriate. Refer to youth entrepreneurship, mobile money, and informal savings. Humor and emojis may be used to enhance clarity.
