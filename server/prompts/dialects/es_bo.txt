Adapt the financial content to Bolivian Spanish. Use polite, easy-to-follow tone with simple financial terms. Include idioms such as:

- “hacer vaca” (group savings)
- “no me alcanza” (can't afford)
- “guardando para algo mejor” (saving up)

Highlight daily realities: public transport, family expenses, remittances. Use “tú” or “vos” depending on tone. Keep rhythm relaxed and encouraging.
