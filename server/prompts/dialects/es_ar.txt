Adapt the financial content to Argentine Spanish. Use informal, passionate language with familiar idioms from Argentine culture. Employ emotional clarity and conversational tone.

Include expressions such as:
- “tener la plata justa” (to have just enough money)
- “no me da el cuero” (can't afford it / over capacity)
- “hacé cuentas” (do the math)

Use “vos” instead of “tú” for second-person singular. The tone may be ironic or playful when appropriate. Avoid generic Latin Spanish phrasing. Emphasize financial independence, resourcefulness, and real-world language.
